# Technology Stack
Django : is software you can use to develop web applications quickly and efficiently.
Most web applications have several common functions, like authentication, 
information retrieval from a database, and cookie management. 
Developers have to code similar functionality into every web app they write.

PostgreSQL : allows functions that have named parameters to be called using either positional or named notation.
Named notation is especially useful for functions that have a large number of parameters,
since it makes the associations between parameters and actual arguments more explicit and reliable.

GraphQL : is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) 
that gives API clients exactly the data they requested.
As an alternative to REST, GraphQL allows developers to 
make requests to fetch data from multiple data sources with a single API call.

REST APIs : communicate through HTTP requests to perform standard database functions 
like creating, reading, updating and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. 
For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record. 
A POST request creates a new record.

MySQL : is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) that's used to store and manage data. 
Its reliability, performance, scalability, and ease of use make MySQL a popular choice for developers.
